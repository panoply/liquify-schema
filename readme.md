# @liquify/schema

This module contains [JSON Schema Stores](https://json-schema.org/) which are used by the [Liquify](https://liquify.dev) IDE extension. This package is available on the npm registry for modules consumed within the project.

**The [sections](#shopify-sections) schema store that was written for the Shopify Liquid variation is not MIT. Please ask permission before using, borrowing logic and/or adapting it into your projects. Unless you have consent, you cannot implement the structures.**

> **Note**&nbsp;
> This only applies to the section schema store - all other schemas are MIT.

### Why?

Liquify supports completions and validations for JSON files and embedded regions. Projects using the Liquify IDE tool require these stores to provide intellisense features.

# Usage

If you are using the Liquify extension ([vscode-liquid](https://github.com/panoply/vscode-liquid)) these stores will be provided automatically. In cases where you require reference to the stores explicitly, then you can implement them using the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) CDN.

When referencing a schema, it is assumed that your text editor supports JSON `$schema` properties.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@liquify/schema/{store}"
}
```

> Replace the `{store}` portion with the appropriate Schema Store [below](#schema-stores).

### Internal Usage

Using the module within the workspace points `main` in the root package.json to the `/package` directory.
