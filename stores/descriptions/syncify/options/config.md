Syncify will look for configuration files in the root of your project but this might not always be ideal as it can create clutter in your workspace. You can optionally place these **config** files within a sub-directory (relative to root).

The directory you define here will instruct Syncify to look for external configurations files, such as those you'd use with **spawn** processes etc.
