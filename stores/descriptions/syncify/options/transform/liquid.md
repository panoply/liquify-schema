Liquid and HTML minification options. By default, the option is set to `false` which disables minification being applied to `.liquid` file types. Setting this to `true` will enabled minification.

> **NOTE**
>
> Terse operations require explicit `--prod` OR `--terse` flags be provided. Failure to pass such flags will result in minification being skipped.
