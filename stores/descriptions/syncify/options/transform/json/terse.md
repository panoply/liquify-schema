JSON minification options. By default, this option is set to `false` which disables minification being applied to `.json` file types. Setting this to `true` will enabled JSON minification to apply.

> **NOTE**
>
> Terse operations require the explicit `--prod` OR `--terse` flags be provided. Failure to pass such flags will result in minification being skipped."
