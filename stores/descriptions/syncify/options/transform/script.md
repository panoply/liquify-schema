**Script**

The `script` transform option which supports TypeScript (`.ts` and `.tsx`) and/or JavaScript (`.js` and `.jsx`) bundling using [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). Script transforms use a pre-defined set of processing configurations and will produce lean JavaScript bundles designed to work seamlessly in development mode or when leveraging HOT reloads.

Syncify will also apply refinements to distribution bundles focused on performance when generating production builds for your Shopify theme.
