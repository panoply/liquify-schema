**Style**

The `style` transform option can be used for CSS (`.css`) and SCSS/SASS (`.scss` or `.sass`) bundling. Style transform support is made possible by using compilers like [Dart SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) and/or [Tailwind](tailwindcss.com).

The `style` option provides developers with replicated configuration control but you may also prefer to use standard config files (e.g: `postcss.config.js`) which Syncify also supports.
