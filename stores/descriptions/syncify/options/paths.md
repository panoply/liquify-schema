**Paths**

Define the development theme structure of your project. You can create path maps to different locations within your project and Syncify will re-route them to the accepted theme structure imposed by Shopify. You cannot define reverse paths and globs must be relative to your root directory.

All paths must point to directories and files contained within the `input` directory defined. You can optionally omit the entry from paths as Syncify will normalize and prepend that to all values defined.
