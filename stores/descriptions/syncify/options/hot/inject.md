Whether or not Syncify should inject the required HOT snippet at runtime layout/s. When `false` you will need to manually place the `hot.js.liquid` snippet into your theme.

**Please note** By default when running `--hot` Syncify will check your layout/s for the hot snippet and if it's not present then syncify will inject it and invoke an upload of the layouts.
