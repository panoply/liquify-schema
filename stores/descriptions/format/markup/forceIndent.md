### Force Indent

Will force indentation upon all content and tags without regard for the text nodes. To some degree this rule emulates a result similar to that you'd expect in Prettier. Inline preservation is respected in cases where a Liquid output object token is encapsulated between text nodes. In such scenarios the text content will only force indent the start and end portions.
