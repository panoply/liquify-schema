How or if markup attributes should be indented each onto their own line. You can optionally provide an integer value of `1` or more. When an integer value is passed, attributes will be forced only if the number of attributes contained on the tag exceeds the supplied value limit. When you define a `wrap` level then attributes will be automatically forced when limit is exceeded unless you've set this rule to `true` or provided an integer threshold.
