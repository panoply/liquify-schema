### Delimiter Terminus

Whether or not ending HTML tag delimiters should be forced onto a newline. This will emulate the style of Prettier's `singleAttributePerLine` formatting option, wherein the last `>` delimiter character breaks itself onto a new line. Though this output style was popularized by Prettier, the resulting structures produced are far from elegant (aesthetically).
