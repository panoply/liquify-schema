### Delimiter Placement

Controls the placement of opening and closing Liquid tag delimiters (`{%`, `{{`, `}}` and `%}`). This rule provides 3 different formatting options and will ensure that delimiters are beautified in concordance. When the rule is `undefined` it will default to using `none`.

### Options

This is a Liquid specific formatting rule which defaults to using `preserve` when no option has been specified. The **recommended** option to use is `consistent` or `force-multiline`.

- preserve
- default
- inline
- consistent
- force
- force-multiline
