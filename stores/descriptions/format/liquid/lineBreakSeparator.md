Controls the placement of Liquid separator type characters in new line structures. In situations where you write a multiline tag expression this rule can augment the order of leading operator characters such as the parameter comma `,` separator.

This rule will not break tag content on to new lines for you, it instead together with the inferred structure you've expressed. This means that you will need to manually new line the arguments.

### Options

This is a Liquid specific formatting rule which will default to `after` when no option has been specified.

- before
- after
