A preset ruleset style guide to use. This will assign rules according to a set of defaults to produce a certain beautification result. If this rule is `undefined` it will default to using `default` which is least obtrusive formatting style.

**Options**

**`default`** (required)

> This is the **default** and the most unobtrusive. Formatting will use a preservationist based technique with this preset mode.

**`recommended`**

> This style guide is typically suited for most cases, it will apply a base set of rules aligned with the Ã†sthetic approach.

**`warrington`**

> This style guide preset is best suited for developers and specifically teams working with Shopify themes. The preset was curated by the talented [David Warrington](https://ellodave.dev/).

**`strict`**

> This is a strict ruleset curated by the projects author [Panoply (sissel)](https://github.com/panoply).

**`shopify`** ðŸ¤¡

> Replicates the Prettier style of formatting. If you've used the Shopify Liquid Prettier Plugin and enjoy that beautification style using this preset will produce the same results.
