The string characters to comprise a single indentation. Any string combination is accepted. Generally speaking, you should leave this alone unless you know what you are doing.

The `indentSize` rule will use this character. For example, if you were to set `indentSize` to `4` then this character will be repeated 4 times, ie: `    ` - by default the `indentSize` is set to `2`.
