Automatically correct some sloppiness in Liquid code. The rule allows Æsthetic to reason with intended structures. The option acts as a very mild form of linting, wherein invalid or language specification preferred code will attempt to be corrected in the least obtrusive manner possible with respect to the language specification standards.

Enabling this rule is not going to produce miracles and for the most part will have little effect overall but can help in some situations.

> **NOTE**
>
> This rule is still experimental and will be both improved and refined in future versions.
